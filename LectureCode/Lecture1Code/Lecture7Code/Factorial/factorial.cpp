 * A little "hello world"-level first look at recursion. This program computes
 * the factorial of a non-zero integer input by the user.
 *
 * n! = { 1         if n = 1
 *      { n(n-1)!   otherwise
 *
 * We use this program to demonstrate that the way stack frames push and pop
 * with function call and return is the same for "normal" functions as for
 * recursive functions. This version includes a little "debugging"-style
 * output of the memory addresses where the 'n' parameter for each recursive
 * call stack frame are stored, to see the layout of stack frames in memory
 * matches what we learned about the memory model in lecture.
