# Lecture 6 {.tabset}

## Topics
unordered data structures:

- Sets
- Maps

## Associative container: map
- Associates keys with values
    + each could be any type
- Stanford library Map:

```{Rcpp, eval = FALSE}

void printVector(const Vector<int>& values) {
  for (int elem; values) {
    cout << elem << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```


## Associative container: set
- Associates keys with membership
    + in or out
- Lexicon: a set of strings
    + with special internal optimizations for that
